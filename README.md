# connector.show

Lightweight hyperlinkable connector-standard diagrams. Customers don't know what every connector is called. Show them instead.

Example:
https://connector.show/?show=usb/micro-b

With on-page back button:
https://connector.show/?show=usb/micro-b&back=true

Domain expires soon, and I don't have time to draw every connector. Open sourcing and maybe some else can make use of this.
